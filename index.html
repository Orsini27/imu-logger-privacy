<h1>Privacy Policy – IMU Logger App</h1>
<p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 January 2026</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
IMU Logger App is a mobile application designed for the collection and analysis of
human motion data using inertial sensors (IMU) available on Android devices.
The application is intended for research, clinical, and academic purposes,
particularly in the context of gait analysis and movement asymmetry studies.
</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, how it is stored,
and what rights users have, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
and Google Play policies.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collected</h2>

<h3>2.1 Participant Profile Data</h3>
<p>
When the application is used for the first time, the participant may be asked to provide
the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Height (in centimeters)</li>
    <li>Gender (Male, Female, None of the options, Prefer not to say)</li>
    <li>Dominant leg (Left or Right)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is used exclusively to improve the interpretation of biomechanical data
and can be edited later through the application interface.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Sensor and Motion Data</h3>
<p>
During data recording sessions, the application may collect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accelerometer data</li>
    <li>Gyroscope data</li>
    <li>Magnetometer data</li>
    <li>Linear acceleration</li>
    <li>Gravity vector</li>
    <li>Orientation (quaternions)</li>
    <li>Step detection events</li>
    <li>Relative timestamps</li>
</ul>

<p>
These data are strictly related to motion analysis and do not contain direct personal identifiers.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Technical and Calibration Data</h3>
<p>
The application may also store technical metadata such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device identifier (Android device ID)</li>
    <li>Device placement (e.g., pocket location)</li>
    <li>Initial foot used during calibration</li>
</ul>

<p>
The device identifier is a technical identifier provided by the Android system and
does not reveal the user's identity, phone number, or contact information.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>

<h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
<p>
Collected data are initially stored locally on the device in CSV files.
Each file contains metadata in the first line followed by time-series sensor data.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Remote Storage</h3>
<p>
When an internet connection is available, CSV files may be uploaded automatically
to a remote storage service (Supabase Storage) for backup and further analysis.
</p>

<h2>4. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
<p>
The collected data are used exclusively for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scientific and academic research</li>
    <li>Human movement and gait analysis</li>
    <li>Biomechanical pattern analysis</li>
    <li>Detection and study of movement asymmetries</li>
    <li>Development, testing, and validation of motion analysis algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>
The application does not provide medical diagnoses and is not intended to replace
professional clinical assessment.
</p>

<p>
The data are not used for advertising, marketing, or commercial profiling.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
The application does not sell or share data with third parties for commercial purposes.
Access to the data is limited to authorized researchers or developers involved in the project.
Any publication or analysis uses anonymized or aggregated data whenever possible.
</p>

<h2>6. Legal Basis</h2>
<p>
Data processing is based on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>User consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR)</li>
    <li>Scientific research purposes (Article 9(2)(j) GDPR)</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
Data are retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy.
Users may request data deletion where technically and legally possible.
Uninstalling the application removes locally stored data from the device.
</p>

<h2>8. User Rights</h2>
<p>
In accordance with GDPR, users have the right to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access their data</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of data</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
    <li>Restrict or object to data processing</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect user data,
including local application storage, secure transmission, and restricted access.
However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure.
</p>

<h2>10. Children</h2>
<p>
The application may be used by minors only under the supervision of a legal guardian,
particularly in clinical or research settings.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected on this page
with an updated revision date.
</p>
